## Abstract: 

This project investigates the impact of where 30% renewable penetrations and storage
is interconnected into a IEEE 24 bus test power system. Its inspiration comes from a
previous project I completed that needed a more realistic and applied investigation, which
this provides. Given data from a 2017 Texas load profile, one week from each season is
simulated to test the phase angle stability of each node in the power system and the overall
operational cost. The optimal topology for the addition of renewable generation to the power
system was found to be in a scattered, non-centralized arrangement of renewables. Storage
proved to improve stability in testing situations of peak load, and a clustered, centralized
configuration of storage emerged as the best implementation strategy. This project serves as
a basis for many potential, influential future projects on power system topology that would
be impactful in a world with growing renewable penetrations and storage dependence.
